\title{Create weights time series for calibration/diagnostic evaluation}
\usage{
rvn_gen_obsweights(
  ts,
  criterion = "BETWEEN",
  startdate = "1785-10-05",
  enddate = "2500-01-01"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{xts time series}

\item{criterion}{criterion used to determine weighted vs. non-weighted dates
one of 'BEFORE', 'AFTER', 'BETWEEN', 'BETWEEN_CYCLIC'}

\item{startdate}{Date indicating start of time period (for 'BETWEEN' or
'AFTER' criterion) or start of annual cyclic period (for 'BETWEEN_CYCLIC'). In
the latter case, only the julian day of the startdate matters.}

\item{enddate}{Date indicating end of time period (for 'BETWEEN' or
'BEFORE' criterion) or end of annual cyclic period (for 'BETWEEN_CYCLIC'). In
the latter case, only the julian day of the enddate matters.}
}
\value{
{wts}{returns numeric vector of weights}
}
\description{
Creates an observation data weights time series based upon dates stored in
an xts time series and criterion given by the user
}
\details{
for criterion ='BEFORE', all timestamps prior to the enddate have a
weight of 1, 0 otherwise
for criterion ='AFTER', all timestamps after the startdate have a
weight of 1, 0 otherwise
for criterion ='BETWEEN', all timestamps after the startdate and before
the enddate have a weight of 1, 0 otherwise
for criterion ='BETWEEN_CYCLIC', all julian days after the startdate and before
the enddate have a weight of 1, 0 otherwise; if startdate is more than enddate,
then the opposite is true, e.g, for startdate="2002-11-01" and enddate "2002-01-31",
only November, December and January timestamps have a weight of 1

  # and only after March 2003:
  wts<-obsweights.gen(flows,criterion="AFTER",startdate="2003-03-01")
  wts2=wts2*wts # product merges weights

  obsweightsfile.create("JohnCreekWts.rvt",wts2,13,typestr="HYDROGRAPH")
