\description{
Writes a Raven rvi file based on one of several template model configurations.
}
\details{
Raven has the capability of emulating a number of existing model configurations, and a number of additional
novel model configurations are provided which may be helpful to the user. These can be written with this function
for ease of getting started with a model using Raven.

The modelname parameter should be one of "UBCWM", "HBV-EC", "GR4J", "CdnShield", "MOHYSE", "HMETS", or "HYPR".

This function uses the same model template files that are provided in the Raven User's manual, Appendix D.
The :CreateRVPTemplate command is included in each rvi file on the assumption that the user will
wish to create an rvp template file following the creation of the rvi file.

The \code{\link{rvn_write_Raven_newfile}} is used to write a header in the rvi file. Writing of a header
can be disabled with writeheader=FALSE.
}
\examples{

# write the Canadian Shield configuration to 'mymodel.rvi'
rvn_rvi_write_template(modelname="CdnShield",
   filename=file.path(tempdir(), "mymodel.rvi"))

# write the HMETS model with some additional details in the description
rvn_rvi_write_template(modelname="HMETS",
   filename=file.path(tempdir(), "mynewmodel.rvi"),
   author="Robert Chlumsky",
   description="RVI file for the HMETS model (Martel, 2017) created by RavenR")

}
