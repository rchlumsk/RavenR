#' Read in Raven Hydrograph file
#'
#' hyd.read is used to read in the Hydrographs.csv file produced by the
#' modelling Framework Raven.
#'
#' This function expects a full file path to the Hydrographs.csv file, then
#' reads in the file using read.csv. The main advantage of this function is
#' renaming the columns to nicer names and extracting the units into something
#' much easier to read.
#'
#' This function is also built to support the hyd.extract function, which uses
#' the object created here for extracting by reference to the columns named
#' here, for example sub24.
#'
#' ff is the full file path of the Hydrographs.csv file. If the file is located
#' in the current working directory, then simply the name of the file is
#' sufficient.
#'
#' tzone is a string indicating the timezone of the supplied Hydrographs file. The
#' timezone provided is coded into the resulting hyd data frame using the as.POSIXct
#' function. If no timezone is provided, this is left as an empty string, and is
#' determined by the function as the current time zone.
#'
#' @param ff full file path to the Hydrographs.csv file
#' @param tzone string indicating the timezone of the data in ff
#' @return \item{hyd}{data frame from the file with standardized names}
#' @seealso \code{\link{hyd.extract}} for extraction tools related to the
#' hyd.read output file
