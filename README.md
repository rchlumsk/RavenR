# RavenR <img src="inst/extdata/logo/RavenR_logo_small.png" align="right" />

`RavenR` is an R package for handling [Raven](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/) hydrologic modelling framework
inputs, outputs, and diagnostics. 

## Installation

The CRAN version of the package may also installed with:
``` r
install.packages("RavenR")
```

You can also install the latest `RavenR` version from github with:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rchlumsk/RavenR")
```

The developmental version can be installed from the `dev` branch with:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rchlumsk/RavenR", ref="dev")
```

## Tutorials and Quick Start Guide

Please see the package vignette for an overview of the `RavenR` package. 
Sample data is included in the package, so you need only
to install the `RavenR` library and follow along in the guide documents to
get started.

The `RavenR` vignette can be accessed with the `browseVignettes` function.
``` r
browseVignettes("RavenR")
```

## Version Update Notes

### 2.1.4

Updates to a number of functions and new features implemented, including:

  - removal of all dependencies on spatial packages (e.g. sf, raster),
    and removal of the netcdf-related functions; 
  - `rvn_download` and `rvn_run` to enable downloading and running Raven.exe within R;    
  - `rvn_rvi_write_template` to write model rvi files from templates in the Raven manual;
  - `rvn_budyko_plot` to generate a budyko curve from model precip, AET, and PET;
  - updates to rvi mapping, including improvements to add functionality from `ggrepel` library
    in spacing labels, and addition of the `DiagrammeR` library to support `rvn_rvi_process_diagrammer`;
  - `rvn_budyko_plot` to generate a budyko curve from model precip, AET, and PET;
  - updates to handling rvt reading and writing, which is now generic for all rvt types; and
  - `rvn_met_interpolate` for performing inverse distance weighting interpolation to fill 
    missing data values in meteorological data (works immediately with `weathercan` downloads).

### 2.0.0

Major updates to the package, including core package styling such as
function case, naming conventions, and use of ggplot2 libraries for
plotting. Some of these include:

  - all core RavenR functions have an ‘rvn\_’ prefix to specify the
    package origin;  
  - functions and input/output variables now use an underscore naming
    convention, rather than periods or camelCase;  
  - ggplot2 is now the default plotting library for plotting functions,
    and some plotting arguments have been reduced, as ggplot objects may
    be modified in post-production by the user;  
  - many new functions added;  
  - new sample data sets and examples, including tidying of all function
    examples and addition of netcdf files to test netcdf-related
    functions; and  
  - multiple bug fixes and improvements to handling rvi, rvh, and
    writing rvt files.
