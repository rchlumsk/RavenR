# RavenR Spatial Workflow

This short document is intended to introduce some workflows for using RavenR in spatial analysis and plotting. If you have not yet completed the **[Introduction to RavenR](https://github.com/rchlumsk/RavenR/blob/master/vignettes/Introduction_to_RavenR.Rmd)** vignette or used RavenR before, it is recommended that you complete that vignette before this one.

## Loading Additional Libraries

This workflow will use some additional libraries that are not required for using RavenR as a standalone package. Please install the packages listed below if they are not already installed, and load the libraries into your session.

```{r load libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(RavenR)
library(magick)
library(gifski)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=10,fig.height=7) #default figure height
```
  
## Check the subbasin network

As a first step, we can examine the model rvh file using tools within `RavenR`. Using the Nith watershed, we can read in the rvh file and allow RavenR to calculate the upstream area of each subbasin.

```{r read rvh file Nith and generate subbasin plot}
# read in rvh file
rvh <- rvn_rvh_read(system.file("extdata","Nith.rvh", package="RavenR"))
head(rvh$SBtable)

# create network plot of watershed structure from rvh file with labels
rvn_subbasin_network_plot(rvh$SBtable, labeled=TRUE)
```

This plot is relatively simple in the Nith, a simple configuration with four subbasins. However, we can also use the same tools to plot the network the Liard model (located in the Northwest Territories), which has more subbasins.

```{r download and unzip the Liard model, eval=FALSE}
# download the Liard Raven model from http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Downloads.html
download.file(url="http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/files/LiardRiverModel.zip",
              destfile="LiardRiverModel.zip")
unzip("LiardRiverModel.zip", exdir="LiardRiverModel")
```


```{r network plot for Liard model, message=FALSE}
# read in the rvh file for the Liard model
rvh <- rvn_rvh_read("LiardRiverModel/Liard.rvh")

# create the subbasin network plot
rvn_subbasin_network_plot(rvh$SBtable, labeled=TRUE)
```

## Create a basic subbasin map

First, we create a basic map of the subbasin using simple tools within `ggplot2`. There are a number of ways to accomplish this, but here we use the `geom_sf` function to plot the subbasins and fill the colours based on subbasin ID.

```{r basic subbasin map only with ggplot}
shpfilename <- system.file("extdata","Nith_shapefile_sample.shp",package="RavenR")
shp <- sf::read_sf(shpfilename)

# convert discrete variable into a factor for easy plotting
shp$subID <- as.factor(shp$subID)

ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=shp, aes(fill=subID))
```

We can also plot custom output data to the subbasin map. The `RavenR` package has a function (\code\link{rvn_subbasin_map}}) to accomplish this, which uses the `geom_sf` function to create a plot after pre-processing the custom data to adjust the plot fill colours. 

```{r basic map with custom output using the RavenR package}
# Custom Output data from Raven for Nith basin
cust.data <- rvn_custom_read(system.file("extdata","run1_PRECIP_Daily_Average_BySubbasin.csv",
                                         package="RavenR"))

subIDcol <- 'subID' # attribute in shapefile with subbasin IDs
plot.date <- "2003-03-30" # date for which to plot custom data

# function call for a static image
rvn_subbasin_map(shpfilename, subIDcol, plot.date, cust.data)+
  scale_fill_gradient(low='white', high='blue', limits=c(1, 10))
```

  
## Animate a Subbasin Map

Here, we provide a wrapper for the \code{\link{rvn_subbasin_map}} function to generate a series of saved subbasin maps for different time steps, and merge them into a single gif. This code essentially loops the function for each time step, saves an image file into a temporary folder, and then merges the images to form an animated gif. It is worth nothing that the \code{rvn_subbasin_map} function uses the `ggplot2` library with the \code{\link{geom_sf}} function to plot the data.

First, we define the `SBMap_animate` function that use the `RavenR` functionality linked with ImageMagick through the `magick` library for manipulating images.

```{r define SBMap_animate function}
SBMap_animate <- function(shpfilename,subIDcol,plot.daterange,cust.data,
                          gif.filename='subbasin_animated_plot.gif',
                          gif.speed=1,
                          cleanup=TRUE) {
  current.wd <- getwd()
  rand.dir <- paste0('scratch_SBMap',"_",paste0(ceiling(runif(20,min=0,max=10)),collapse=""))
  dir.create(rand.dir)
  # get the dates to plot from the supplied plot.daterange object
  plot.dates <- lubridate::date(cust.data[plot.daterange])
  for (i in seq(1,length(plot.dates))) {
    # png(file=paste0(rand.dir,"/",sprintf("plot_%02d.png",i)), width=500, height=500)
    p1 <- RavenR::rvn_subbasin_map(shpfilename,subIDcol,plot.dates[i],cust.data)+
      scale_fill_gradient(low='white', high='blue', limits=c(1, 10))+
                            ggtitle("Average PRECIP by Subbasin")
    ggsave(paste0(rand.dir,"/",sprintf("plot_%02d.png",i)),
           plot=p1,
           dpi=100)
  }

  # generate an animation from the images created
  pp <- list.files(pattern='*\\.png', recursive=TRUE)
  pp <- pp[grep(rand.dir,pp)]
  img <- image_read(pp)
  image_write_gif(img, path=gif.filename, delay=gif.speed)
  # delete subfolder
  if (cleanup) { unlink(rand.dir,recursive = T,force = T) }
  return(TRUE)
}
```

Now, we use this function to animate custom output precipitation data for the Nith river watershed, and generate a gif of daily precipitation from Jan 1st to Jan 15th, 2003. This may take some time.

```{r generate gif for Nith precipitation, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# function call for an animated image
SBMap_animate(shpfilename = shpfilename,
              subIDcol = 'subID',
              plot.daterange = "2003-01-01/2003-01-15",
              cust.data,
              gif.speed=0.25)
```

The resulting animated image is shown below.

![Nith watershed animation with precipitation custom output data.](subbasin_animated_plot.gif)

Note that other tools exist in R that could have been used for this purpose. For example, \link{gganimate} could be used to simplify the code we have above. 

## Interactive mapping with plotly

The `plotly` package is a common one for creating interactive plots (see some [examples](https://plotly.com/r/#maps)). A basic plotly figure provides interactive labels for the data, as well as figure controls such as a zoom function. A basic example is provided below, displaying daily rainfall as a barplot using RavenR sample forcing data.


```{r basic plotly example with forcing data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)

data("rvn_forcing_data")
forcing_data <- rvn_fortify_xts(rvn_forcing_data$forcings)

fig <- plot_ly(data = forcing_data, x = ~Date, y = ~rain, type='bar')
fig
```

The `plotly` library can also be used to create interactive maps. The most basic way to do this is to read in a shapefile, and plot it directly with plotly. Here, we read in the Liard shapefile and plot it with plotly. We use the general \code{\link{plot_ly}} function, although \code{\link{plot_geo}} could also be used.

```{r basic plotly map for Liard watershed, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shp_Liard <- sf::read_sf("./LiardRiverModel/shapefiles/subbasin_20180718.shp")
plot_ly(shp_Liard)
```

We can also convert a ggplot object to a plotly object, which can be helpful for those familiar with the ggplot2 syntax.

```{r convert ggplot object to plotly for basic choropleth map}
# convert discrete variable into a factor for easy plotting
shp_Liard$Sub_B <-  as.factor(shp_Liard$Sub_B)

# add random precipitation data for plotting, up to 25mm
shp_Liard$precip <- runif(n=nrow(shp_Liard), min=0, max=25)

# create ggplot object
g1 <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=shp_Liard, aes(fill=precip, group=Sub_B))
g1

# plot with plotly instead
ggplotly(g1)
```


### Dynamic Choropleth map with plotly

In this example, a dynamic and interactive choropleth map of the Nith watershed is generated using the `plotly` library. This will plot the custom output daily precipitation for each subbasin in the Nith watershed.

Here, the Nith geospatial data will be converted to geojson format in this process. We begin by preparing the custom output and geospatial data for plotting.

```{r read in and prepare data custom output data for plotting, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)

precip <- system.file("extdata",
                      "run1_PRECIP_Daily_Average_BySubbasin.csv",
                                         package="RavenR") %>% 
rvn_custom_read()

# subset the data to March 2003 to reduce rendering time 
precip <- precip["2003-03-01/2003-03-31"]

precip <- rvn_fortify_xts(precip)

precip_long <- precip %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=colnames(precip)[-1], 
               values_to="precip",
               names_to="subID")

precip_long$hover <- sprintf("hru:%s precip:%.1f", precip_long$subID, precip_long$precip)
precip_long$date <- as.character(precip_long$Date)
```

```{r read in and prepare data geospatial data for plotting, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(raster)
library(geojsonsf)
library(geojsonio)
library(rjson)

## read shapefile as sf and reproject into lat/long
shp <- system.file("extdata","Nith_shapefile_sample.shp",package="RavenR") %>% 
  sf::read_sf(.)

# convert to lat/long coordinates
if (as.character(crs(shp)) != "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs") {
  shp <- st_transform(shp, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")
}
names(shp) <- tolower(names(shp))

## convert to geojson
subbasin_utm <- geojson_json(shp,
                             geometry = "polygon",
                             group = 'group')
temp_json <- tempfile(fileext=".json")
geojson_write(subbasin_utm, file = temp_json)

# Reading in the saved geojson file
subbasin_geojson <- rjson::fromJSON(file=temp_json)
```

We can now plot the data using our geojson with the plotly library. Note: you will need to Zoom in to the Nith watershed from the global map produced initially.

```{r dynamic choropleth map }
# Setting font and label styles
fontstyle <- list(
  size = 16,
  color = "black")
    
label <- list(
  bgcolor = "#EEEEEE",
  bordercolor = "transparent",
  font = fontstyle
)

# Plotting animated map
fig <- plot_ly(precip_long,
               frame = ~date) %>% 
  add_trace(
    type = "choropleth",
    geojson = subbasin_geojson,
    locations = precip_long$subID,
    z = precip_long$precip,
    color = precip_long$precip,
    colorscale = 'YlGnBu',
    reversescale = TRUE,
    featureidkey = "properties.subid",
    zmin=0,
    zmax=max(precip_long$precip),
    text = ~hover,
    hoverinfo = 'text') %>%
  style(hoverlabel = label) %>%
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE) %>% 
  colorbar(ticksuffix = "mm")

fig
```


## Live Map with leaflet

The [leaflet package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) in R brings the utilities from leaflet (https://leafletjs.com/), a JavaScript library, directly into R. This utility allows us to make interactive spatial maps easily within R.

### Single data point leaflet map

We can add the subbasin data for the Nith watershed directly into a leaflet map. First, let's create a very basic leaflet map in the area around the University of Waterloo campus.

```{r initial leaflet map}
library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-80.542764, lat=43.471794, popup="University of Waterloo - Main Campus")
m
```

We can add our shapefile data to this map as well, although we will need to convert the Nith shapefile into lat/long coordinates first. Additionally, satellite view is often more helpful than streetview in hydrologic applications, so we will switch the basemap to ESRI World Imagery.


```{r leaflet map with shapefile polygons}
# transform from UTM17N to lat/long WGS84
basinshp <- read_sf(shpfilename)
basinshp_latlong <- st_transform(basinshp, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")

m <- leaflet(basinshp_latlong) %>%
  addProviderTiles('Esri.WorldImagery') %>%  # add ESRI satellite imagery
  addMarkers(lng=-80.542764, lat=43.471794, popup="University of Waterloo - Main Campus") %>% 
  addPolygons(opacity=0.75)
m
```

This displays the data, however, if we want to 1) adjust the colour of subbasins based on their numbering, and 2) make the data from the shapefile interactive to the user (i.e. click on the subbasin and see its properties), we adjust our code as per the block below. Note that with leaflet, we must define the labels and colour palette manually.

```{r leaflet map with shapefile and labels}
# calculate areas from GIS
basinshp_latlong$area <- st_area(basinshp_latlong)/1e6

# define labels for each polygon
labels <- sprintf(
  "<strong>subID</strong> %s, <strong>area</strong> %.1f km<sup>2</sup>",
  basinshp_latlong$subID, basinshp_latlong$area) %>% 
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

# define colours for each polygon
pal <- colorBin("inferno", domain = basinshp_latlong$subID)

m <- leaflet(basinshp_latlong) %>%
  addProviderTiles('Esri.WorldImagery') %>%  # add ESRI satellite imagery
  addMarkers(lng=-80.542764, lat=43.471794, popup="University of Waterloo - Main Campus") %>% 
  addPolygons(opacity=0.9,
      label = labels,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto"),
    fillColor = ~pal(subID),
    color='White',
    weight=1)
m
```

# Exercise 1 - Custom Data Subbasin Plot for Liard watershed

In this exercise, we will use the Liard model and supplementary data to create a subbasin map based on output from the Liard model. You will use the :CustomOutput function in Raven to generate daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration outputs for each subbasin, calculate an average annual aridity ratio (P/PET) for each subbasin, and plot this data by subbasin.

Your solution to this exercise should follow these steps:

1. Download the Liard data from http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Downloads.html and unzip them (using R!)  

2. Modify the Liard.rvi file to generate the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration custom outputs, and re-run the Raven model for the Liard basin.

3. Read in the data and calculate the annual average aridity ratio for each subbasin (hint: the \code{\link{rvn_custom_read}} and \code{\link{rvn_apply_wyearly}} functions may be helpful here). 

4. Read in the Liard subbasin shapefile; create a simple map of the subbasin first.

5. Plot the average annual aridity ratio to each subbasin (use either ggplot+geom_sf or the \code{\link{rvn_subbasin_map}} function).


# Exercise 2 - Interactive leaflet map for the Liard Basin

Following from Exercise 1, create an aesthetically pleasing and interactive map of the Liard basin. You may use the `tmap` or `mapview` libraries instead of `leaflet` if you prefer.

Bonus: add the average annual aridity ratio to the interactive map, both to adjust the fill colour of each subbasin and as text that appears when the subbasin is selected.

# Exercise 3 - Dynamic choropleth map for the Liard Basin

Using the examples for the Nith basin, generic a dynamic choropleth map using the `plotly` library for the Liard Basin. Modify the Liard.rvi file to output custom output (daily average precipitation by subbasin, or your choice of forcing or other output), and use that data as input for the choropleth.

\newpage

## Other packages for interactive mapping

While we demonstrate interactive mapping using the `leaflet` and `plotly` libraries here, other packages exist with similar functionality; some of these may even be easier to use. For example, you are encouraged to take a look at the [tmap library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) and the [mapview](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/) library.
